JamChat
=======

This was a project for Wireless sensor networks. Our concept was to implement a chat application that would send messages
over local connections, eliminating a need for an internet connection. At first we tried using wifi direct which ended
up having too many complications, so we tried switching to bluetooth. You will find out code for both the bluetooth
version and the wifi direct version included in the src files. 

Improvements
============

In the future we hope to get the app working with wifi direct as that would allow us to have multiple connections instead
of just one on one chatting as that is all this app currently supports.
